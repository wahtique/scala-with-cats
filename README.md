# Scala with Cats in Scala 3

Implementation of the exercises from the book "Scala with Cats" using Scala 3, Cats 2 and mill.

It's my own interpretation using my current 11 months of experience as a full-time Scala dev...and less than a week of practice in Scala 3 as of the beginning of my Cats journey. 

## Run Locally

  git clone git@github.com:wahtique/scala-with-cats.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd scala-with-cats
```

Run any exercise with mill

```bash
  mill -w CHAPTER.EXERCISE # -w enables re-run on changes
```
